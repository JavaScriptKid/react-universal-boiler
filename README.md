# Boldr Universal React Starter

A **bold** way to begin your next great universal React application.

## Features
- A pleasant üòç developer experience with üî• fast bundling, so you can get shit done. This starter takes advantage of tools like, [HappyPack](https://github.com/amireh/happypack) and the [DLL capabilities](http://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#dllplugin) within Webpack itself. Your rebuilds happen fast because, nobody enjoys waiting around like a  üê¢  while assets recompile.
- [React-Hot-Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader): Build your React components with less full page reloads thanks to hot module replacement and React Hot Loader.
- Code Splitting: Give your visitors the best experience possible by allowing their browsers to only download what's necessary.
